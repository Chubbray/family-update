*Family-Update

I first got my repository set up, then I moved on to adding the README and the .gitignore. Once that was completed and saved, I added the models and routes folders. I then added in the index.js, reaction.js, thought.js, and user.js files. Then I put in the code for index.js and got started on user.js.
I now have all of the models and routes, I have also created config and server.js. I made sure that I have all of the npm installs that I need.
Now when I run npm start I get and error of DEP0018 a promise rejection. I have been trying to find it but I think I just need to submit what I have.
I was not able to get the error cleared so I never got a chance to run it on insomnia. I will try to get back to it later.
