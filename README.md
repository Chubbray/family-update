*Family-Update

I first got my repository set up, then I moved on to adding the README and the .gitignore. Once that was completed and saved, I added the models and routes folders. I then added in the index.js, reaction.js, thought.js, and user.js files. Then I put in the code for index.js and got started on user.js.
